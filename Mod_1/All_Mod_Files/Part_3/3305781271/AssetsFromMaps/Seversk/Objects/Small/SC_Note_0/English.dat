Interactability_Text_Line_4 According to headquarters, remote regions of the Russian Federation have been designated as temporary shelters for refugees.

The Seversk archipelago has been identified as one of the priority locations by the UN leadership.

Interactability_Text_Line_6 Peacekeepers are expected to arrive on the island from the mainland shortly. It’s difficult to say how well we’ll work together with our Western colleagues, but orders are orders. I hope we can coordinate effectively, otherwise, the situation could become even more dire.
