Message_0_Page_0 If there is two things that will greatly help you succeed it is: vehicles and setting up a base.
Message_0_Page_1 Vehicles have large trunk space that will help you manage the load. Setting up a base will allow you to sort out your items, create a respawn point and you can also keep your vehicle safe!
Message_0_Page_2 Wood will likely be the easiest choice to build your base out of but consider upgrading to brick or metals if you are planning to settle down.
Response_0 Good to know!
