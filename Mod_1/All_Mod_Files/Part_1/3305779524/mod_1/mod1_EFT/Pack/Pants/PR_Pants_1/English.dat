Description Clothing for your lower body parts, do I really need to further explain the concept of pants to you? Okay! Trousers or pants are an item of clothing that might have originated in Central Asia, worn from the waist to the ankles, covering both legs separately. In the United Kingdom, the word pants generally means underwear and not trousers.
