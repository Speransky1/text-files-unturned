Interactability_Text_Line_0 Report №1123: Operation "Perspective"
Interactability_Text_Line_1 Date: November 17, 1985
Interactability_Text_Line_2 -------------------
Interactability_Text_Line_3 To the Commander of the General Staff of the Soviet Union,
Interactability_Text_Line_4 As part of Operation "Perspective" our intelligence inside the Western States confirmed increased enemy military activity in the border areas. The "Perspective" underground complex continues to provide a robust defense against nuclear war threats.
Interactability_Text_Line_5 Conditions in the bunker are becoming increasingly tense, emphasizing the need for psychological support for the comrades. Increased counterintelligence and deeper penetration into the enemy's inner circles to gain more information on his plans is recommended.
Interactability_Text_Line_6 Kind Regards,
Interactability_Text_Line_7 Commander of the Operation "Perspective" task force
