Interactability_Text_Line_2 Hi, Alexei!

Interactability_Text_Line_4 I recently found your old letters, the ones you wrote from your service in the airfield. I don't remember exactly what it was called, I think it was Kahramaan Airfield. Do you remember how you complained about the eternal heat and the sand that went everywhere, even into the cockpit of your jets? And those stories you told about endless flights over the desert - as if you were crossing the borders between worlds.

Interactability_Text_Line_6 I wondered how things had changed. The Union is long gone, and there are only scraps of memories from those times. Your work location is probably in ruins by now, if it's still standing. And you know, When I read your letters, it feels as though I am teleported to that place. You're in uniform, tanned, confident, flying in the Far East, and I'm a little guy who dreams of being like you one day.

Interactability_Text_Line_8 If fate throws you back to those parts, write to me someday. Tell me what's left there, if there are any traces of those times. Or maybe everything has already been erased, like the sand that once clogged the engines of your airplanes? I just want to know if there's anything left of the world that was so important to both of us.
