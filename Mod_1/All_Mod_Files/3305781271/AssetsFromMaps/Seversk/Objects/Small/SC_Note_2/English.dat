Interactability_Text_Line_2 I can't take it anymore. It's already '92, and they still make us fix this rusty piece of scrap metal. The BMP-1 is falling apart before our eyes - yesterday we used wire to hold the turret up somehow. The engine of the MT-LB has stalled again, and there are no spare parts, as always.

Interactability_Text_Line_4 Funding? It's just a mockery. All you hear from Moscow is: “Hold on, everything will get better soon.” Yes, it will, but not for us. We're like a deserted island, forgotten by everyone.

Interactability_Text_Line_6 Did they promise new equipment? Where is it? The airbase is dying. The 712th Complex is dying, the radar's failing, and there's only enough fuel for a couple of flights a week.

Interactability_Text_Line_8 And worst of all, it's this damn infection. We were told that our task was to settle the situation on the archipelago and prevent mass unrest among the locals. But who's gonna protect us? No proper masks, no medicine. Every time I put on an old gas mask soaked with sweat and dirt, I wonder: will it protect me at least a little, or is it just a semblance of care?

Interactability_Text_Line_10 People, and crowds, come to the outpost every day. They demand to be let into the airfield - they want to fly away from this cursed island as soon as possible. They say the peacekeepers from the mainland can't cope in Pugachevka. But we know that if we let one infected person through, it's the end. A lot of them are already coughing, and looking sick. Or maybe it's just anger and hunger.

Interactability_Text_Line_12 We're pushing them out as fast as we can, but people are getting more and more aggressive. A few days ago they threw a stone at a soldier - it hit his helmet. What will happen next, it's scary even to think about

Interactability_Text_Line_14 We're holding the outpost with our last strength. The soldiers are tired, the equipment can't be repaired, and the mood is below zero. If it goes on like this, I'm afraid that not only our equipment will collapse, but also ourselves.
