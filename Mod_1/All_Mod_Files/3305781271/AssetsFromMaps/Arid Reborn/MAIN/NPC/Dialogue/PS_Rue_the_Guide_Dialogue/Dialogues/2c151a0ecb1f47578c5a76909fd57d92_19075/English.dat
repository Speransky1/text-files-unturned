Message_0_Page_0 There are two bunkers. One of them has three segments, the entrance to the first segment is in the radar station, for it you will need to get a key to enter, as well as nightvision or flashlight. For the next segments you will also need keys. But be careful, there is a deadzone in the third segment.
