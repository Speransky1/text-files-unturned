Message_0_Page_0 You are going to need a gasmask and filters, they can both be crafted from resources you can find around the map. There's two deadzones on the map. The first is located within the bunker complex.
Message_0_Page_1 The other deadazone is located on the far north-east end of the map. Make sure to have the full biohazard suit if you are planning to visit Fort Knell in the north-east.
