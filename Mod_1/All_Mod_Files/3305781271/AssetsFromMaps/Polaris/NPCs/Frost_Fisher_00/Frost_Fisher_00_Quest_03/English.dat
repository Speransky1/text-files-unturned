Description The <color=#c832fa>Sakhalin Fish</color> is LITERALLY the rarest specimen in these frosty oceans. I bet you won't be able to EVER catch it! You know what, I'm so confident that I bet my own <color=#c832fa>Sakhalin Fish</color> that you won't catch one! It is my most prized possession, it was caught by my great great great great grandfather, and passed down throughout generations.
