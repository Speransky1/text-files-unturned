Name FirstSpear Strandhogg plate carrier (Ranger Green)
Description Taking its name from an Old Norse Viking term for a lightning raid, Strandhogg was one of the first formalized battle tactics to use covert infiltrators in advance of an actual raiding operation. Strandhogg was a tactical game changer in its time, just like the technological advances FirstSpear is bringing forward in this line of plate carriers.
