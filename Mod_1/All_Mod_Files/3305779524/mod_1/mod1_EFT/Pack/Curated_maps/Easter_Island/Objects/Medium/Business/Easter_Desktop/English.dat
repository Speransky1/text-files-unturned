Interactability_Text_Line_1 ----------------
Interactability_Text_Line_2 How's it goin Hun! I haven't heard from you in a while.
I'm getting a little worried about you; I finally have something interesting to tell you though!
(Interesting to me at least :P)
Interactability_Text_Line_3 We bought loads of weapons - trunks of them - and they're being hauled over on a freight ship. They got ordered with specialized padlocks, so we have a universal master key that can open any of the lockers. 
Interactability_Text_Line_4 Funny thing though, I lost it. Not even kidding, it's completely out of sight. No where to be found. I bet that doesn't sound one bit strange to you though, Ha.
Interactability_Text_Line_5 Luckily, our buddies down at Station Charlie near Rano Kau have a spare key. So as long as we can get it, we'll be first ones to test some of the experimental weapons. Just have to wait until that shipment arrives. It's a day or two late, so lucky for us, we still have a chance to get first dibs.
Interactability_Text_Line_6 I know you get a little uncomfortable when I'm so enthusiastic about killer death machines though, so I'll spare you the rest of the details :S
Interactability_Text_Line_7 Anyways, I'm back on patrol. I'll talk to you tommorow, honey.
